# CS4243: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – Project Implementations

This repository contains my solutions for the coursework in **CS4243: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**. The assignments explore foundational AI techniques through practical implementations, focusing on **search algorithms**, **constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)**, **local search**, and **adversarial game-playing strategies**.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Search Algorithms – Maze Solver
Implemented three classical search strategies:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**

**Application**: These algorithms are applied to solve a maze navigation problem, finding the optimal path from a start point to a goal.

### Project 2: CSP and Local Search

#### Part 1: Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Solver
- Built a **CSP solver using backtracking** to solve general CSPs.
- Incorporated techniques such as:
  - Variable ordering
  - Forward checking
  - Constraint propagation

#### Part 2: Local Search & Extended CSP
- Implemented a **local search algorithm** to find valid and optimized states.
- Extended CSP solver to handle more complex constraints and configurations.

### Project 3: Adversarial Search – Modified Chess Game

- Developed a **game-playing AI using Alpha-Beta Pruning** to make strategic decisions in a modified version of chess.
- Optimized performance through:
  - Depth-limited search
  - Heuristic evaluations
  - Move ordering
